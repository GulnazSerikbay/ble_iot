Abstract
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is one of the most used wireless communication protocols supported
by nearly all modern operating systems. BLE has been an integral part of smart home,
health sectors and personal wearable devices. With the increasing significance of Bluetoothembedded
systems, it is vital to identify potential security vulnerabilities in Bluetooth-connected
devices. Since the data transferred over these connectionsmight be sensitive, users are vulnerable
to privacy attacks through their wearable devices, wireless mouse, smart locks, smartwatches,
wireless headphones, etc.
This study attempts to analyze the security of BLE pairings, specifically focusing on the
pairings for Human Interface devices like BLE-enabled mouse. The experimental setup exploits
Bluetooth USB dongles and Ubertooth One, an open-source 2.4 GHz wireless development
platformused formaking Bluetooth experimentations.
